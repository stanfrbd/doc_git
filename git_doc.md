# Why is Git different?

"Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots." [git-scm](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)

# Configuration

* This command sets the author name and email address respectively to be used with your commits.
e.g. your GitHub account email address.

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"
$ git config --global core.editor vim # or nano or emacs but don't cry after that
```

# SSH (use it!!!)

* [Generating a new pair of SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

* [Adding public key to you GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

* [For GitHub fans: GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

```bash
# start the ssh-agent in the background
$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
> Agent pid 59566

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/$privateKey
Enter passphrase for ~/.ssh/$privateKey
# Great! You won't have to type your passphrase again until you close this terminal
```

---

# Initialize a new repository

```bash
$ mkdir $localRepoName
$ cd $localRepoName
$ git init

# if you created an empty repo **with the same name** on GitHub:

$ vim README.md
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "Initial commit" # commit local changes

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:$userName/$localRepoName.git
$ git branch -M main # 'main' was master before
$ git push -u origin main # push files to GitHub

```
---

# Clone a repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/$userName/$repoName.git
```
* Remember you can use SSH
* Remember to use the SSH agent
---

# Add files

```bash
$ git add <files> # <files> will be tracked by git
$ git add . # when using a .gitignore
```

* You can use a `.gitignore`  that should be commited before adding specific files

```bash
# .gitignore 
# ignore objects files
*.o
# ignore the 'test' folder and everythin inside
test/
```

---

# Commit changes

```bash
$ git commit -m "message"

# or if you don't mind
$ git commit -a
```

---

# Push to a server

```bash
$ git push <optional $branch> # that can be `git push origin $branch`
```

---

# Tag a commit

```bash
$ git commit -m "this commit will be tagged"
$ git tag "version-0.0"
$ git push --tags

# On GitHub, a tag initialises a release, very useful.
# Using DevOps, a tag can launch a pipeline (trigger on a specific tag). 

```

---

# Pull 

```bash
$ git pull # sync with the server
```

---

# Compare files

```bash
$ git diff # This command shows the file differences which are not yet staged.

# show differences between branches
$ git diff $firstBranch $secondBranch
```

---

# Status of the repository

```bash
$ git status # shows changed files and untracked files

# useful for git reset --hard
# show the history of the commits for the current branch, and their ID
$ git log
